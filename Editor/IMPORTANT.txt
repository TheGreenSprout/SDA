- Would be nice to have a way to add references in the XML (i think it was check or something, you can put a link to a different script).
- Make the excluded paths' toggle a saved editor preference.

+ Fix: Allow the parsing and injection of subclasses and submethods (classes within classes, and methods within subclasses).
