# -------------->| 🌱 Sprout's Document Asistant (SDA) 🌱 |<--------------


## Thank you for downloading SDA! I'm Sprout (TheGreenSprout in most social accounts). -> https://sprouts-garden.netlify.app

My intention when making this package is to make the boring process of writing XML
documentation way easier! It also has a few other features, them being the project
structure/information generation tools.
That's what this package is for!
Enjoy :D


#### P.D: Use this package for anything you like, but if you do, please leave this readme untouched in order to credit me! :b
